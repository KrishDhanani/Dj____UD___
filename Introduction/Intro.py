# Intro about how data is transferring among the internet

# Web application technologies:
# Browser: is Build upon HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, JQuery etc.
# Web Server: is Build upon Django, Flask, Sqlite3, Mysql etc

# Each time a user clicks on anchor tag with a href = value to switch to a new page, the browser make connection to a web server and issue a "GET" request - to GET the content of the page at the specific URL.
# The server returns the HTML document to the browser, which formats and displays the document to the user.


# (Some Computer Network Portion need to understand)
# Network Sockets:
# Socket: combination of ip address and port number
# HTTP (Hyper text transfer protocol) protocol uses to communicate with web server.
# URL: Uniform Resource Locator (e.g. http://data.pre4e.org:5050/page1.htm)
# http://  <-- protocol
# data.pre4e.org  <-- host name
# 5050 <-- port number
# page1.htm  <-- document(page)
