# In this Section we are Building Blog Project

# Create our blog Project & App
# Add URLs & Views
# Add Templates and Static files

# Firstly, we create a website and inside there is one section(App) name as blog

# Planning URLs & Views:
# / --> Load starting page which lists the latest blog post and some welcome text
# /posts --> Load page which list of all blog posts
# /posts/my-first-page (or like /posts/<slug> Here slug is Dynamic) --> Load individual blog post page which shows in detail blog posts


# Remember:
# You cant access the content of dictionary by giving in a square bracket key you need to use dot notation always
# use like post.title
