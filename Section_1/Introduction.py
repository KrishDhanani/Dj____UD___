# To run the server, the code is: (But remember that your terminal is set to that folder in which you want to run manage.py file)
# python manage.py runserver

# Now to start with challenges, the code is:
# python manage.py startapp challenges
# This code creates a bunch of different files in the "challenges" folder(App).

# Here the main folder Section_1 inside one another Section_1 folder use it to configuration the project.

# Now here inside the main folder you see "challenges" name folder it is known as "app".
# We can say it holds one type feature of our entire project.
# We can also create many apps as we require like app1, app2.

# So all this app coexists in Section_1 name main folder.

# "Apps" are building blocks for the overall project.
# "App" ~= "Module"

# For Example:
# Project: Google
# App: Google Search, Google Images, Google Maps.

# Project: Amazon
# App: Amazon Shop, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music

# Project: Your own Online Shop
# App: One App or Products, Cart, Admin Area

# Now
# In our App, there is A Bunch of files and migration folder
